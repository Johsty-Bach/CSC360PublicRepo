This code was for a "worst implementation competition" and is intentionally designed to be awful while still being functional.

Some of the key changes made to make this code terrible are:
- Horrific formatting. All code is crammed onto a single massive line for each file.
- Cryptic variable names. All variable names are random unicode characters that don't convey anything about what they are supposed to represent.
- Needless complexity. Practices like recursion and lambda functions are in places where they don't make any sense, making the code overcomplicated.
- We used Java's reflection in order to dynamically call methods that could just be called directly instead.
- Conditionals, arithmetic operations, and string manipulations are padded with unnecessary complexity.
- No comments or documentation whatsoever.
